Package oop.ex6:

package main:
Sjavac: Main class which runs the program

Package parser:
BadLineException: Exception class, inherits from Exception and is thrown when there is a syntax error.
DeclarationParser: The declaration parser class parses variable assignment and declaration lines,
                   the class inherits from Parser.
FileParser: The class is in charge of reading the file and inserting its lines into a List of Strings
MethodCallParser: The class is in charge of parsing a method call line, the class inherits from Parser.
MethodDeclarationParser: The class is in charge of parsing a method declaration line,
                         the class inherits from Parser.
Parser: the class is an abstract class and it contains all of the needed regex's for the different parser classes
Token: The class is in charge of creating a token from a single line and checking its syntax,
       the class inherits from Parser.
Tokenizer: The class runs is in charge of the pre processing of the code (in order to save the global variables as
           well as the method properties) and the validation of the entire code.

Package SymbolTable:
MethodSymbolTable: The class represents a symbol table for the programs methods,
                   the class inherits from HashMap<String, List<VariableData>> (typedef)
VariableData: The class represents a single variable, it consists of its type and modifier
VariableSymbolTable: The class represents a symbol table for the programs variables,
                     the class inherits from HashMap<String, VariableData> (typedef)

Package Utils:
Pair: The class represents a pair which has two generic values
Utils: The class holds utility function used across the program

Package verifier:
BadLogicException: Exception class, inherits from Exception and is thrown when there is a logic error.
MethodCallVerifier: The class implements the Verifier interface and is in
                    charge of verifying the logic of a method call line.
MethodDeclarationVerifier: The class implements the Verifier interface and is in
                           charge of verifying the logic of a method declaration line.
VariableAssignmentVerifier: The class implements the Verifier interface and is in
                            charge of verifying the logic of a variable assignment line.
VariableDeclarationVerifier: The class implements the Verifier interface and is in
                             charge of verifying the logic of a variable declaration line.
Verifier: An interface for the verifiers, has one function called verify
VerifierManager: A factory class which is in charge of running each of the verifiers
WhileIfVerifierManager: The class implements the Verifier interface and is in
                        charge of verifying the logic of a if/while statement.

Design: The design of our program divides into two main components, the first is to validate the syntax of the given
        file and the second id the validate the logic of the sjava class. the first part is handled by the parser
        package and the second is handled by the verifier package.
        in the parser package we understood the all of the parsers will need to use similar regex's therefore we create
        the abstract class Parser (we decided to make it abstract because there is no reason to create an instance of
        that class) which hold all of the regex's and the different parser classes inherit from it.
        In the verifier package we decided to make use of the factory design pattern, where the VerifierManeger will
        decide for each given token which verifier will handle it. The reason we chose the implement a Factory was
        that we wanted that our verifier to have one place where it decides which verifier to run
        (Single Choice principle) and that it would be easy to add new verifiers in the future
        (Modularity and the open-close principle).

Implementation Issues: One of the issues we encountered was that we needed to know if we where within a method or not
                       and handle it accordingly, the solution we used is that we don't call the verifierManager for
                       every token from the same location. We divided it up between calls made from the global scope
                       and calls made from within a function, that way we could handle each case accordingly
